  <p align="left"><span lang="cs">This game is outcome of my first attempt to 
  make a game playable b</span>y anyone. By people not used to computer games 
  like my coleques that do clay and pottery. This game is to be played using 
  only one button and you can switch language of game, either English or Czech 
  thats why its called that way. Later I also made a star wars eddition of this 
  game that is also awayable- <a href="../STAR_WARS/STAR_WARS.htm">STAR WARS</a>

  <p align="left">Game play</p>
  <p align="left">there are always 2 guys fighting on the screen both hidden 
  behind some kind of obstacles. Their goal is to shoot down the oponent by 
  uncover self going above the obstacle then shoot and dug imidietly. It may 
  sound pretty vague but the game it self is very simple, you will understand 
  the game system very fast.</p>
  <p align="left">You can enjoy 3 game modes, STORY MODE- u fight 4 enemies that 
  get stronger while progressing in story. 2PLAYER MODE- u can play with ur 
  friend on computer, only onebutton for one player is required so it is nice 
  thing to play. TRAINING MODE - in this mode u play with a pretty good player. 
  U can change the speed of bullets using + or - key, with high speed u can 
  experience almost the movie feel. </div>
