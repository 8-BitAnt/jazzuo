  <p align="left">This is 2nd game of extreme hocky and its called 3d since i 
  tried to use some 3d rendered graphix. Its very bold game, very similar to the 
  first extreme hocky but much faster bloodier and chaotic.</div>
<div style="width: 639; height: 93; border-style: solid; border-width: 1; padding-left: 4; padding-right: 4; padding-top: 1; padding-bottom: 1">
  ok changes from first extreme hocky<p><br>
  there is an change in attack i hope youll like tis improvement<br>
  you have to attack with high speed otherwise you wount be able to put enemy on 
  ground he will be dameged but soon will wake up to do next move<br>
  <br>
  also there is such thing now as hp whn you have less hp you move slow and get 
  down on ice easily<br>
  <br>
  new contro; bottan is:<br>
  x by pressing x you can visibilize or invisibilize hpbars<br>
  <br>
  ok to get to the main controles. In this game you can controle only one player 
  at a time. you change the player to play by clicking space or by biing cnocked 
  down.<br>
  movements. You move by mouse. When the left mouse bottonis clicked the player 
  will head to the mouse position. <br>
  action<br>
  V-you cross check(do not warry to use it a lot because there is no foul)<br>
  C-shoot (do not wary about where to shoot. player will automaticly shoot the 
  puk to the enemy goal and there is no goleman so not wary about that either)<br>
  <br>
  rules- when player is standing he can shoot or bounce the puk or to be 
  crosschecked. When youare crosscheking you cannot bounce the puk. While you 
  are shooting you cannot crosscheck. When you are down you cannot do anything.<br>
  <br>
  hint: you ask how to get positive score? well you just gota do better.When you 
  need to crosscheck go one step ahead of enemy players when you want to shoot 
  read the movement of puk. <br>
  When you are stuck with what ever try to crosscheck your self out.</p>
