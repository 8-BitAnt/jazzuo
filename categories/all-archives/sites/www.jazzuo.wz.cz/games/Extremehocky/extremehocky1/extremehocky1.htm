  <p align="left">This is one of first game i made... i believe my second. It 
  did pretty well in an oficial competition of Gmemaker games, and had fearly 
  large exposure. There are still some fantics playing this game saying its the 
  best thing ever. This is a second eddition with some correction of fyziks.</div>

  how to play this game you ask? well first of all let me tell you that this 
  hocky game is quite violent so if you do not like blood to see, Well too bad. 
  For the others surely its great fun and remember this is not the way to play 
  real hocky!!<br>
  ok to get to the controles. In this game you can controle only one player at a 
  time. you change the player to play by clicking space or by biing cnocked 
  down.<br>
  movements. You move by mouse. When the left mouse bottonis clicked the player 
  will head to the mouse position. <br>
  action<br>
  V-you cross check(do not warry to use it a lot because there is no foul)<br>
  C-shoot (do not wary about where to shoot. player will automaticly shoot the 
  puk to the enemy goal and there is no goleman so not wary about that either)<br>
  <br>
  rules- when player is standing he can shoot or bounce the puk or to be 
  crosschecked. When youare crosscheking you cannot bounce the puk. While you 
  are shooting you cannot crosscheck. When you are down you cannot do anything.<br>
  <br>
  hint: you ask how to get positive score? well you just gota do better.When you 
  need to crosscheck go one step ahead of enemy players when you want to shoot 
  read the movement of puk. <font FACE="Arial"><p>&nbsp;</font></div>
