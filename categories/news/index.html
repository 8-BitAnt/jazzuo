    <br>
    <span>Currently just cleaning up the site to make the front page contain less links, everything else can be found in the "More" section. I also added more types of archives under the "All Archives" link. This will contain old sites made by Jazzuo and videos he made.<br><br>

    <span>Hey there! I figured I'd put out this post to update everyone on the sites current state, I have slowly been updating the site and adding more games and I hope to add all of them pretty soon! (Were almost there!) Once every game has it's own page and also to ensure we have every game on the list I will release a complete download of all of Jazzuo's games so it's easier for you to download all of them. The Czech version of the site has also been removed for now until it's completed. Hope you're all having a great day!<br><br>
      
      Also you should check out the <a href="https://gamebanana.com/games/17716">Sexy Hiking Modding Community</a> if you haven't already!<br><br>

    <span class="bigtext">Jazzuo.net has been rebranded!</span><br>
    <br>
  <span>Hello, guys! After forgetting to renew the domain for Jazzuo.fun, a bot bought it and now uses it to redirect to inappropriate material. We couldn't buy it back, so we decided to buy Jazzuo.net instead! Besides, many people are more familiar with the new extension. I'll be occasionally making more games available and continuing to work on the site in the coming days. I hope you're all having a nice day!<br><br>

    <span class="bigtext">Hello World!</span><br>
    <br>
  <span>The site has just been switched from <a href="/https://replit.com/">Replit</a> to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and should be a lot more stable than it previously was. The site is still a huge WIP so expect a lot of it to still be pretty broken. Feel free to join our server for updates!<br><br>

  The site is still a WIP but be sure to stop by here and there to see if there are any changes, every day we add more games to make them more easily accessible to fans of his work and hopefully most of them will be here soon, stay tuned!<br>
