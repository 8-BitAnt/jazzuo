<p>This is the extreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeme hocky game isometric!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Made by  Jazzuoknow also as Yu the jesus(just by apearence i do look as jesus as pictured)!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>The game is made on the best game making program ever The gamemaker!!!</p>
<p>how to play this game you ask? well first of all let me tell you that this hocky game is quite violent so if you do not like blood to see, Well too bad. For the others surely its great fun and remember this is not the way to play real hocky!!</p>
<p>ok to get to the controles. In this game you can controle only one player </p>
<p>movements. You move by mouse. When the left mouse bottonis clicked the player will head to the mouse position. </p>
<p>action</p>
<p>V-you atack check(do not warry to use it a lot because there is no foul-when you have speed and atack in front youll do a crosscheck and you pull down enemy imidietly,othervise hit them five times to put them down!!!)(when two atacks hit each other it cansels it self)</p>
<p>C-shoot</p><br>

<p>rules- when player is standing he can shoot take puk or to be crosschecked. When youare crosscheking you cannot tach the puk. While you are shooting you cannot attack. When you are down you cannot do anything.</p><br>

<p>hint: you ask how to get positive score? well you just gota do better.When you need to crosscheck go one step ahead of enemy players when you want to shoot read the movement of puk. </p>
<p>When you are stuck with what ever try to beat your self out.</p<br>

<p>And last thing to remember I love Yu and you love me, everybody loves Yu</p>
