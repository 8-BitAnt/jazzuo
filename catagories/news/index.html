    <span>Hey there! I figured I'd put out this post to update everyone on the sites current state, I have slowly been updating the site and adding more games and I hope to add all of them pretty soon! (Were almost there!) Once every game has it's own page and also to ensure we have every game on the list I will release a complete download of all of Jazzuo's games so it's easier for you all to access. The Czech version of the site has also been removed for now until it's completed. Hope you're all having a great day!<br><br>
      
      Also you should check out the <a href="https://gamebanana.com/games/17716">Sexy Hiking Modding Community</a> if you haven't already!<br><br>

  <span>The site has just been switched from <a href="/https://replit.com/">Replit</a> to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and should be a lot more stable than it previously was. The site is still a huge WIP so expect a lot of it to still be pretty broken. Feel free to join our server for updates!<br><br>
